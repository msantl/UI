Artificial Intelligence laboratory assignments

1. laboratory assignment - Night bridge crossing problem

  (a) blind search, uniform cost
  (b) A\* algorithm with folowing heuristics
    (1) the time needed for remaining students to cross is greater or equal to 
        the time needed for the slowest one
    (2) the time needed for remaining students to cross is greater or equal to
        the sum of following crossings:
          - slowest and second slowest are going together
          - third slowest and fourth slowest are going together
          - fifth slowest and sixth slowest are going together
          - ....
